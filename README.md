The purpose of this project is to predict whether the continuation of the stock price trend is an increase ðŸ“ˆ or a decrease ðŸ“‰.
First section of the project was data collection from the web.
I used crawling ðŸ”Ž in order to get the data i need for the project.

After crawling the data, I had a lot of unuseful data and had to deal with them.

Visualizing the data ðŸ“Š -  helped me to understand my data and to check the corelations between all the features while using different plots.

End of the project was the prediction of my research. I used the SKlearn library and used 2 different models: KNN and Decision Tree.
The result of the project was fantastic and got 70 percent of precision ðŸ™‚
